        Interfaces (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)
        Higher Order Functions (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)

Channels
    Data types to enable communication between Goroutines
    Declaration
        var ch chan int
    Instantiation
        ch = make(chan int)
    Operations ( using <- operator )
        Send Operation
            ch <- 100
        Receive Operation
            data := <- ch

    Important:
        A RECEIVE operation is ALWAYS a blocking operation
        A SEND operation is blocked UNTIL a receive operation is initiated
